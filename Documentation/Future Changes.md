## PCBs
### Main PCB V2.0
* ~~Move touch connector slot down by 1-2mm (measure)~~
* ~~Move top alignment slots further apart~~
* ~~Use NRF in QFN package (instead of aQFN) (NRF52840 or NRF54 if released)~~
* ~~Use STM32U5G9 in UFBGA-144 package (instead of STM32U5A9 in TFBGA-216)~~
* ~~Move NRF53 inductors further apart / fix footprint~~

### Lower Flex PCB V1.0
* Increase board name silkscreen size
* Shorten connection between main section and section with mounting holes by 1mm
* (Change haptic motor voltage to 3.3V? Need to check)

### Test Rig PCB V2.0
* Use through hole pogo pins (for longer ones especially)
* Increase current limiting resistors to make LEDs less bright

## Mechanical & CAD
### Bottom Frame
* Add mounting holes
* Add rim to support module PCB
* Move flex PCB arm channel up by 1mm (measure)

### Top Frame
* Remake CAD model using ovals
* Add mounting holes
